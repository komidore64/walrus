# walrus

command-line toolset for running a CraftBukkit server

## why?

As a big fan of Minecraft, especially playing multiplayer with my friends, I quickly found it difficult to manage a Craftbukkit server instance on my home server. I turned to Screen, Cron, and Bash scripts. This is based on those scripts I first wrote with a (hopefully) unified functionality and interface in mind.

## project state

the current state of the project is broken. almost everything is hard-coded. first on my TODO list is to get it working and to run more flexibly.

## overviewer

i have [minecraft-overviewer](http://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer) in a submodule this project because it's a really really cool project and i think it should be included with every craftbukkit server!

## help

i'd love to get others involved in making a nice set of command-line tools. make your own fork of `walrus` and submit your code with a pull-request.
