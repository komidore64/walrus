Command-line toolset for running a CraftBukkit server

## why?

As a big fan of Minecraft, especially playing multiplayer with my friends, I quickly found it difficult to manage a Craftbukkit server instance on my home server. I turned to Screen, Cron, and Bash scripts. This is based on those scripts I first wrote with a unified command-line interface.

## project state

The current state of the project is broken. Almost everything is hard-coded. First on my TODO list is to get it working and to be more portable.

## overviewer

I have [minecraft-overviewer](http://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer) in a submodule of this project because it's a really really cool project and I think it should be included with every craftbukkit server!

## help

I'd love to get others involved in making a nice set of command-line tools. Make your own fork of `walrus` and submit your code with a pull-request.
